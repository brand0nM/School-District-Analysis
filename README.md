Overview of the school district analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is well defined (3 pt).
Results:

There is a bulleted list that addresses how each of the seven school district metrics was affected by the changes in the data (10 pt).
Summary:

There is a statement summarizing four changes to the school district analysis after reading and math scores have been replaced (5 pt).
# School District Analysis
## Project Overview
We have been tasked with analyzing standardized test data to gleam insights on school performace; This analysis will discuss how factors like school size, type (public or charter), and the amount spend per student affect the pass rate. 

### Purpose
We will deploy a python jupyter notebook to read and merge two .csv files, then investigate this data.

## Analysis
Before we can start this analysis we've been informed that the 9th graders from Thomas High School have corrupt data. To rectify this mistake we must first replace the 9th graders math and reading score with N/A values. <br />

Now we are going to merge the schools and students data frame; this allow us to manipulate both data frames at once. <br />

The district budget, average math/reading scores and pass percentages are shown below. <br />

### Schools Average Reading and Math Scores by Grade
From the table below its clear the variance of scores between grades is relatively low; hence, grade level is not a determining factor for standardized test scores.
